# Smile-vs-Not-Smile-Detector

This is a program written in Keras to detect if an image has a smiling human (out = 1) or someone not smiling (out = 0)

The training and the testing dataset has been taken from one of the programming exercises of Andrew NG's course on Convolutional Neural Networks.

I've optimized the code to achieve a training accuracy of about 100 % and a testing accuracy of 98.667 %. Additional modifications to the hyperparameters or a somewhat different neural network architechture can probably yeild better results.
The neural network architechture used by me is partly inspired from the paper Parkhi et al.: Deep Face Recognition.
